According to Merriam-Webster dictionary of English language, toilet paper is a "thin sanitary absorbent paper usually in a roll for use in drying or cleaning oneself after defecation and urination."

Worldwide, the equivalent of almost 27,000 trees is either flushed or dumped in landfills every day in a form of toilet paper. That is literally shoving money down the drain.
